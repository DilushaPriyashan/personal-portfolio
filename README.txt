Design and functionality of my personal website, which was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The website serves as a digital representation of my professional identity, featuring various sections and interactive elements to engage visitors.

Navigation Bar:
The website's homepage features a navigation bar that allows users to easily access different sections of the site. I wrote Javascript function to see what section there are in this nav bar.

Hover Effects:
To enhance the visual appeal of the website, I incorporated CSS styles that create interactive hover effects. These effects include changing colors, size changing, and highlighting elements when users hover their mouse over certain page components.

Typing Title Text:
In the header section of the website, I used JavaScript to implement a dynamic title text that simulates typing and deleting, creating an engaging and eye-catching introduction.

Social Media Links:
I included icons from various websites, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, HackerRank, GitHub, and Twitter, and linked them to my corresponding social media accounts. This makes it easy for visitors to connect with me on these platforms.

Education Section:
For the education section, I utilized basic card elements to present relevant education details. Each card contains information about a specific educational experience, enhancing the readability of the content.

Skills Section:
To showcase my skills, I added icons sourced from various websites, and I implemented CSS hover styles to add interactivity. When users hover over a skill, it becomes zoom in, background color changing.

Projects Section:
The projects section is designed with a horizontal scroll bar, allowing users to navigate through a list of projects. I also included an arrowhead that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function to scroll to the next project, improving the user experience. In here also I used CSS hover styles, when someone goes over the project card the project details are riseing up.

Contact Section:
In the contact section,I listed down my contact informations using <ul> in html and  I included a button that enables visitors to download my CV. I saved the CV within the project and provided a hyperlink for easy access. Additionally, I implemented a JavaScript function to reset the contact form, ensuring that user input is cleared after submission and I cannot store it in some where without a back-end.

Delays and intervals:
I used some delays and intervals to several class to decorate more by visually pleasing when someone visit my website.

Responsitive media:
finally I developed responsitive media for basic dispaly sizes and phone size for this project using CSS styles.
